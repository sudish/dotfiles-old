Steps to make xmonad your windowmanager through gdm while retaining
gnome-session.

1.  Link the user-share-*.desktop files to those directories.
2.  Put xmonad-init.sh in ~/bin

The rest is no longer needed now that WINDOW_MANAGER is set in xmonad-init.sh.
Leaving it here for reference on how to set the wm from gconf. It's better to
leave this at its default value of gnome-wm and let gnome-wm use the value of
WINDOW_MANAGER to start xmonad.

gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/session/required_components/windowmanager sj-xmonad -t string
