# https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/commits/master/

* Release v20:

 - Python versions supported is now v2.7+ and v3.2+ due to rewrite using argparse.
 - Man page and --help has been overhauled to provide better documentation and usage scenarios.
 - Installation scripts now act dependent on current environmental settings.
   If run as root, will do a global install. Installation script also detects which version to install (bash or zsh) dependent on $SHELL.  Both of these behaviors can be overrode using --local/--global or --bash/--zsh arguments.
 - Uninstallation script added, will remove both global and local installations but ignores database.
 - Symlinks can be preserved as database entries, refer to man page for more details.
 - This change log added to better help package maintainers keep track of changes between releases.
