AUTOJUMP
========

----------------------------
A ``cd`` command that learns
----------------------------

One of the most used shell commands is ``cd``. A quick survey among my friends revealed that between 10 and 20% of all commands they type are actually ``cd`` commands! Unfortunately, jumping from one part of your system to another with ``cd`` requires to enter almost the full path, which isn't very practical and requires a lot of keystrokes.

autojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the command line. The jumpstat command shows you the current contents of the database. You need to work a little bit before the database becomes usable. Once your database is reasonably complete, you can "jump" to a commonly used directory by typing:

 j <dir>

where <dir> is a few characters of the directory you want to jump to. It will jump to the most used  directory whose name matches the pattern given in dirspec. Note that autojump isn't meant to be a drop-in replacement for cd, but rather a complement. Cd is fine when staying in the same area of the filesystem; autojump is there to help when you need to jump far away from your current location.

Autojump supports tab completion starting with bash v4.0+.

Pierre Gueth contributed a very nice applet for freedesktop desktops (Gnome/KDE/...). It is called "jumpapplet", try it!

Thanks to Simon Marache-Francisco's outstanding work, autojump now works perfectly with zsh.

Usage Examples
==============

::

 j music

would jump to ``/home/user/music/``, if that's a commonly directory traversed by command line. ::

 autojump music

displays the directory autojump would jump to if invoked. ::

 jumpstat

displays a listing of tracked directories and their respective weights. For example: ::

 ...
 54.5:	/home/shared/misc
 60.0:	/home/user/Dropbox
 96.9:	/home/user/code/autojump
 161.7:	/home/user
 Total key weight: 1077

The "key weight" reflects the amount of time you spend in a directory.
